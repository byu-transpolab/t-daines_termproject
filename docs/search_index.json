On each ramp, there are detectors beneath the pavement located in three areas, including passage (after the ramp meter signal), intermediate (middle of the on-ramp), and excessive queue detectors (near the on-ramp entrance). These detectors provide data that include volume and occupancy counts, ramp meter rate, and the number of lanes on the ramp. UDOT is continuously collecting these data points to analyze ramp and freeway operations. Using these data, this project will seek to develop a reliable algorithm that can accurately reflect ramp meter wait time, which will be published to a website by UDOT, where it will be viewable by the public. The focus of this project will be on the metered on-ramp at Layton Parkway in Davis County, with the aim for the algorithm to then be applied to additional ramps in Utah in the future.

The review will explain in brief detail how ramp meters function and will then go on to explain how the components of the on-ramp impact the amount of time a vehicle will be required to wait on the ramp prior to entering the freeway. Various components such as the number of lanes, the length of the ramp, the ramp metering rate, and the time of day will be considered. The goal of this project is to produce an algorithm that can accurately predict and calculate the wait time based on the previously mentioned attributes of the ramp.
